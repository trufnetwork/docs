To set up a local development environment for the TRUF.network, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

1. **Go**: [Download and install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. **Taskfile**: [Install Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation).
3. **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).
4. **Python** (optional, for running seed scripts): [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads).
5. **Pandas** (optional, for running seed scripts): [Install Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).

**Building Locally**

You can build and run the TRUF-Node using Docker Compose or manually.

_Using Docker Compose (Recommended)_

1. Clone the TSN repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node.git
cd truf-node
```

2. Build and start the TRUF-Node containers:

```bash
task compose
```

This command builds and starts the TRUF-Node in Docker containers with pre-seeded data.

_Manual Build and Run_

1. **Build the Binary**:

```bash
task build
```

This compiles the TRUF-Node binary, which will be located in the `.build/` directory.

2. **Run PostgreSQL**:

Start PostgreSQL using Docker:

```bash
task postgres
```

3. **Run TRUF-Node**:

Start a single-node network:

```bash
task kwild
```

4. **Configure `kwil-cli`**:

Set up `kwil-cli` to interact with TRUF-Node:

```bash
kwil-cli configure
```

Provide the following values when prompted:

- **Kwil RPC URL**: `http://localhost:8484`
- **Kwil Chain ID**: _(leave blank)_
- **Private Key**: _(any Ethereum private key)_

For testing purposes, you can use the private key `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`.

**Running the Kwil Gateway (Optional)**

The Kwil Gateway (KGW) is a load-balancer with authentication capabilities, enabling data privacy protection for Proof of Authority (POA) Kwil blockchain networks. While not required for development, you can run it locally:

1. Navigate to the `deployments/dev-gateway` directory:

```bash
cd deployments/dev-gateway
```

2. Follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node/blob/main/deployments/dev-gateway/README.md) file to set up and run the gateway.

**Running the Indexer**

The indexer collects and processes data from the TSN-DB. To start the indexer:

```bash
task indexer
```

Access the metrics dashboard at `http://localhost:1337/v0/swagger`.

**Fetching the Genesis File**

The genesis file contains the initial configuration for the TSN network. To fetch the latest genesis file:

1. Ensure you have read access to the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory, similar to `.env.example`, and include your GitHub token.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
task get-genesis
```

**System Contract**

The system contract stores accepted streams by TSN governance and serves as an entry point for queries.

_Fetching Records via System Contract_

To fetch records:

```bash
kwil-cli database call -a=get_unsafe_record -n=tsn_system_contract -o=<owner_address> stream_id:<stream_id> date_from:2024-06-01 date_to:2024-06-17 --private-key <private_key> --provider <provider_url>
```

This command retrieves records from the system contract for the specified stream and data provider within the given date range.

**Metrics and Monitoring**

When running the development setup using `task compose-dev`, the following monitoring tools are available:

- **Prometheus**: Accessible at `http://localhost:9090`
- **Grafana**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (default credentials: `admin/admin`)

These tools provide insights into the performance and behavior of the TSN-DB system.

For more details on metrics configuration, refer to the files in the `deployments/dev-gateway` directory.
