description: "Learn how to interact with the truf.network using SDKs."
---

The truf.network offers SDKs in Go and TypeScript/JavaScript to facilitate seamless integration with its decentralized platform for economic data streams.

---

### What is a `streamID`?

A `streamID` is an identifier used in the truf.network (TN) to identify the deployed contract. It is a unique string generated from a descriptive name, such as an English name, to ensure easy reference and management of data streams.

---

### Go SDK

The Go SDK provides tools to publish, compose, and consume economic data streams within the truf.network. It supports operations on primitive streams and composed streams.

_Installation:_

Ensure you have Go 1.20 or later installed. To install the SDK, run:

```bash
go get github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go
```

_Example Usage:_

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/golang-sql/civil"
    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/crypto"
    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/crypto/auth"
    "github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go/core/tsnclient"
    "github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go/core/types"
    "github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go/core/util"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Create TSN client
    pk, _ := crypto.Secp256k1PrivateKeyFromHex("<your-private-key-hex>")
    signer := &auth.EthPersonalSigner{Key: *pk}
    tsnClient, err := tsnclient.NewClient(ctx, "https://staging.tsn.truflation.com", tsnclient.WithSigner(signer))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Load an existing stream
    streamId := util.GenerateStreamId("your-stream-name")
    streamLocator := tsnClient.OwnStreamLocator(streamId)
    stream, err := tsnClient.LoadPrimitiveStream(streamLocator)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Read data from the stream
    dateFrom, _ := civil.ParseDate("2023-01-01")
    dateTo, _ := civil.ParseDate("2023-01-31")
    records, err := stream.GetRecord(ctx, types.GetRecordInput{
        DateFrom: &dateFrom,
        DateTo:   &dateTo,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    for _, record := range records {
        fmt.Println(record.DateValue, record.Value.String())
    }
}
```

For comprehensive examples and usage patterns, refer to the test files in the SDK repository.

### TypeScript/JavaScript SDK

The TypeScript/JavaScript SDK offers similar capabilities as the Go SDK, with implementations tailored for both Node.js and browser environments.

_Installation:_

Ensure you have Node.js 18 or later installed. To install the SDK, run:

```bash
npm install @trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-js
```

_Example Usage:_

```javascript
import { NodeTSNClient, StreamId } from "@trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-js";

// Initialize client
const client = new NodeTSNClient({
	privateKey: "<your-private-key-hex>",
	providerUrl: "https://staging.tsn.truflation.com",
});

// Load an existing stream
const streamId = StreamId.fromName("your-stream-name");
const stream = await client.loadPrimitiveStream(streamId);

// Read data from the stream
const records = await stream.getRecord({
	dateFrom: "2023-01-01",
	dateTo: "2023-01-31",
});

records.forEach((record) => {
	console.log(record.dateValue, record.value.toString());
});
```

For detailed examples and usage patterns, refer to the test files in the SDK repository.
