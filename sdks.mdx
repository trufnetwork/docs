---

The TRUF.network offers SDKs in Go and TypeScript/JavaScript to facilitate seamless integration with its decentralized platform for economic data streams.

---

### What is a `streamID`?

A `streamID` is an identifier used in the TRUF.network (TN) to identify the deployed contract. It is a unique string generated from a descriptive name, such as an English name, to ensure easy reference and management of data streams.

---

### Go SDK

The Go SDK provides tools to publish, compose, and consume economic data streams within the TRUF.network. It supports operations on primitive streams and composed streams.

_Installation:_

Ensure you have Go 1.20 or later installed. To install the SDK, run:

```bash
go get github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go
```

_Example Usage:_

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/golang-sql/civil"
    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/crypto"
    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/crypto/auth"
    "github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go/core/tsnclient"
    "github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go/core/types"
    "github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go/core/util"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Create TSN client
    pk, _ := crypto.Secp256k1PrivateKeyFromHex("<your-private-key-hex>")
    signer := &auth.EthPersonalSigner{Key: *pk}
    tsnClient, err := tsnclient.NewClient(ctx, "https://staging.tsn.truflation.com", tsnclient.WithSigner(signer))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Load an existing stream
    streamId := util.GenerateStreamId("your-stream-name")
    streamLocator := tsnClient.OwnStreamLocator(streamId)
    stream, err := tsnClient.LoadPrimitiveStream(streamLocator)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Read data from the stream
    dateFrom, _ := civil.ParseDate("2023-01-01")
    dateTo, _ := civil.ParseDate("2023-01-31")
    records, err := stream.GetRecord(ctx, types.GetRecordInput{
        DateFrom: &dateFrom,
        DateTo:   &dateTo,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    for _, record := range records {
        fmt.Println(record.DateValue, record.Value.String())
    }
}
```

For comprehensive examples and usage patterns, refer to the test files in the SDK repository.

### TypeScript/JavaScript SDK

The TypeScript/JavaScript SDK offers similar capabilities as the Go SDK, with implementations tailored for both Node.js and browser environments.

_Installation:_

Ensure you have Node.js 18 or later installed. To install the SDK, run:

```bash
npm install @trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-js
```

_Example Usage:_

```javascript
import { NodeTSNClient, StreamId } from "@trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-js";

// Initialize client
const client = new NodeTSNClient({
	privateKey: "<your-private-key-hex>",
	providerUrl: "https://staging.tsn.truflation.com",
});

// Load an existing stream
const streamId = StreamId.fromName("your-stream-name");
const stream = await client.loadPrimitiveStream(streamId);

// Read data from the stream
const records = await stream.getRecord({
	dateFrom: "2023-01-01",
	dateTo: "2023-01-31",
});

records.forEach((record) => {
	console.log(record.dateValue, record.value.toString());
});
```

For detailed examples and usage patterns, refer to the test files in the SDK repository.

### Timestamp support

In the contract version 2, we have added support for timestamps. Replacing the `Date` type with the `number` type in the `GetRecordInput` and `Record` types.

```typescript
interface GetRecordInput {
    dateFrom: number;
    dateTo: number;
}

interface Record {
    dateValue: number;
    value: string;
}

// Read data from the stream with timestamps
const records = await stream.getRecord({
	dateFrom: 1672531200, // 2023-01-01
	dateTo: 1675123200, // 2023-01-31
});
```

For more information about the timestamp interface, feel free to navigate to the SDK repository.
Most of the functions and interfaces are the same as the previous version, but with date values replaced with timestamps.
For example, to deploy a new stream with timestamps, you can use the `deployPrimitiveStream` function with the `contractVersion` parameter set to 2.
