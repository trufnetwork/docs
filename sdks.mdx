The TRUF.NETWORK offers SDKs in Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Python to facilitate seamless integration with its decentralized platform for economic data streams.

## SDK Overview

For detailed installation, usage, and API references, please refer to the respective SDK repositories:

- [Go SDK](https://github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-go)
- [TypeScript/JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-js)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/trufnetwork/sdk-py)

### What is a `streamID`?

A `streamID` is an identifier used in the TRUF.NETWORK (TN) to identify the deployed contract. It is a unique string generated from a descriptive name, such as an English name, to ensure easy reference and management of data streams.

## SDK Capabilities

Each SDK provides comprehensive tools to interact with the TRUF.NETWORK, enabling operations such as:

- Deploying primitive and composed streams
- Inserting and retrieving records
- Managing stream metadata
- Handling stream permissions
- Performing batch operations

## Using SDKs with Your Local Node

<Note>This section is intended for node operators who are running a local TRUF.NETWORK node that is fully synced with the network. If your node is not connected to the network, queries will return empty results because your local database will not contain any data. Always ensure your node is synchronized before using it as an SDK endpoint.</Note>

Before you can fetch data from a stream using the SDKs, you need to know the stream's ID and the data provider address. The easiest way to discover these is by using the [TRUF.NETWORK Explorer](https://truf.network/explorer/0x4710a8d8f0d845da110086812a32de6d90d7ff5c/stai0000000000000000000000000000).

You can use any TRUF.NETWORK SDK (Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python) to interact with your own local node, not just the public gateway. This allows you to fetch data directly from your node, which is especially useful for node operators, validators, and developers.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node is fully synced:**  
   Ensure your node is fully synchronized with the network and has all data available.  
   See the [Node Operator Guide](./node-operator-guide.mdx#7-verify-node-synchronization) for instructions on checking sync status.

2. **Local Endpoint:**  
   Your node should be running and exposing the HTTP API at `http://localhost:8484` (the default).

For specific implementation details, installation instructions, and comprehensive examples, please refer to the individual SDK repositories linked above.
