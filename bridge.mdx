The TRUF Bridge is currently **temporarily down for maintenance**. Please check back later for updates.

Truflation utilizes the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to securely bridge TRUF tokens between Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base. This bridge leverages Chainlink CCIP for secure and programmable token transfers across different blockchain networks. CCIP is designed for high security and scalability, employing a Risk Management Network to monitor for malicious activity continuously. Truflation is an official Chainlink Build partner and among the early adopters to launch with CCIP, highlighting its role in enhancing cross-chain interoperability.
