For guidance, you can look at the existing bug report template used across repositories as a **reference**:

- Include detailed **steps to reproduce** the issue.
- Clearly describe the **expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**.

> - **Expected Behavior**: Numbers displayed correctly in the UI.
> - **Actual Behavior**: Some numbers are missing or displayed as `NaN`.
> - **Steps to Reproduce**:
>   1. Open https://truf-network.vercel.app in the browser.
