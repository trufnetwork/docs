Dear TRUF Nation,

Truflation is poised for monumental growth as we continue to redefine how economic data is gathered, processed, and delivered in real-time. The decision has been made to do a token redistribution. We’ve taken these bold steps to secure our ecosystem and protect our community, ensuring we remain at the forefront of decentralized finance. Our proactive approach not only neutralizes the hacker’s impact but also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to innovation and transparency. The evolution of the TRUF Network, combined with our rollout of new indices, is just the beginning for Truflation, which set out to redefine the future of financial data. As of 11 am UTC, October 29th, 2024 we will be re-distributing TRUF tokens. The snapshot will be taken prior to the claim portal opening.

To access your new tokens, you will need to go through a claim portal. Only whitelisted users will be eligible to migrate their positions. If a wallet address is not on the whitelist, the user won’t be able to claim tokens. The whitelist is managed by the contract owner. All records about user balances and positions will be transcribed from a snapshot of the state of all Truflation contracts taken prior to the migration.

## Instructions

_The claim portal will be open from 11 am UTC on October 29th._

1. Go to [Truflation.com](https://truflation.com) - beware of scammer accounts, we will not post any links.
2. Connect wallet address with Metamask
3. View connected wallet
4. View current positions held with the old token
5. Execute token migration
6. View the success migration message

If you are not eligible then no tokens will be migrated. If you encounter any problems, please use our official Discord and open a support ticket. **We will never ask you for your seed phrase or your secret key.**

## Staking

If your TRUF tokens are staked, you will still need to migrate your tokens. Please note that rewards are paused during the migration. They will be boosted afterward as a gesture of appreciation to loyal community members.

Please only use our official website, do not click on any suspicious links. There are a lot of scammers trying to capitalize on users' trust, so please be vigilant. The following information about the whitelisted entity will be stored in the claim contract:

- **Wallet address.** The address of the token holder that had a certain balance during snapshot time. Wallet addresses will be verified using a signature.
- **New token amount.** The amount of new tokens to be received by the user after migration.

As you are aware these actions are necessary to stop the hacker in their tracks and dissolve the value of the hacker’s tokens. This is a response to the malware attack, where Truflation's multisig wallets were compromised. The investigation is ongoing and we are working with the industry's top cybersecurity firms and international law enforcement agencies. No user funds were compromised. All stakeholders have been alerted and are continually updated.

We want to thank you for your continued support. We will continue to work with law enforcement to pursue all punitive actions. The attack does not impact Truflation’s ongoing development of the TRUF Network, nor our plans to roll out new features, new indices, and our imminent mainnet launch. We will be running a campaign to reward our community members for their loyalty, so please keep an eye on our socials. We’re deeply grateful to our Truflation Nation, our community members, whitehats, and partners who have rallied behind us with unwavering support and expertise. This decisive move to redistribute tokens is not just a safeguard - it’s a catalyst for future growth. Truflation is emerging from this challenge stronger, more resilient, and laser-focused on delivering cutting-edge solutions. Our community, bolstered by unwavering support, is integral to our success, and together we will shape the future of financial data. As we move forward, expect continued innovation, new synthetic assets, perpetual markets, and enhanced transparency through the TRUF Network. Truflation is on the cusp of revolutionizing the financial landscape, and we’re just getting started.
