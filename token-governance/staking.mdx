description: Learn how to stake TRUF tokens to become a TSN node operator and earn rewards.

For a TRUF.network node operator to go live and be able to earn fees on the data they facilitate and/or provide, their address must be whitelisted in the Truflation Protocol. A TSN address can be whitelisted only after they have staked TRUF tokens.

Because individual TRUF.network data streams are not necessarily merged with other data streams, code logic alone cannot make deterministic claims if the data provided is ‘bad’ or ‘good’. Instead of relying on code logic alone, a more nuanced approach is necessary to maintain quality streams. Governance holders can submit fraud reports against node operators where data delivery has been manipulated and has not been detected programmatically through validation of outcomes. Participants in the TRUF.network reported for bad behavior will enter a challenge period where standard fee accrual may be halted until Truflation’s Governance approves a resolution.

Once the TRUF tokens are staked, the participant is eligible to receive veTRUF tokens. The number of veTRUF tokens issued would be determined by both the number of TRUF tokens staked and the length of the lock-up period, which is intended to encourage long-term network commitment.
