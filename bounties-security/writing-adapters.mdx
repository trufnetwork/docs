title: Adapter Writing Guide
description: This guide provides a step-by-step approach to creating adapters for the truf.network (TN). Adapters facilitate the ingestion of data from various sources into TN, leveraging the SDK and Prefect for efficient data management.
---

> **Note**: While adapters use a Python Framework, it's also possible to push data from other languages like Go or JavaScript. Refer to the respective SDKs for more information:

> - [Golang SDK](https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-go)
> - [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-js)

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Knowledge**: Proficiency in Python.
- **Tools**:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
  - [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io)
  - Access to a TN Node (local or remote)
- **Environment Setup**: Clone the [trufnetwork/adapters](https://github.com/trufnetwork/adapters) repository.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trufnetwork/adapters.git
cd adapters
```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

- Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- Update the environment variables in the `.env` file as needed.

3. **Launch Services with Docker Compose**:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command initializes the necessary services in the background.

## Understanding Reusable Tasks

The repository offers several reusable tasks to facilitate data ingestion into TSN:

- **Reading Data**:
- `task_read_repo_csv_file`: Reads a CSV file from a GitHub repository.
- `task_read_gsheet`: Retrieves data from a Google Sheet.

- **TSN Operations**:
- `task_insert_tsn_records`: Inserts records into TSN.
- `task_get_all_tsn_records`: Fetches all records from TSN.
- `task_deploy_primitive_if_needed`: Deploys a primitive if it doesn't already exist.

- **Data Manipulation**:
- `task_reconcile_data`: Reconciles data between sources.
- `task_normalize_source`: Standardizes source data.
- `task_filter_by_source_id`: Filters data based on a source ID.
- `task_prepare_records_for_tsn`: Prepares records for insertion into TSN.

## Developing a Custom Adapter (Python Example)

1. **Define the Data Source**:
   Identify the source and format of the data you intend to ingest.

2. **Create a Prefect Flow**:
   Develop a Prefect flow to manage the data ingestion process. For example:

```python
from prefect import flow
from tsn_adapters.tasks.github import task_read_repo_csv_file
from tsn_adapters.tasks.tsn import task_insert_tsn_records

@flow
def custom_adapter_flow():
    # Read data from the source
    data = task_read_repo_csv_file('repo_name', 'path/to/file.csv')
    # Insert data into TSN
    task_insert_tsn_records('stream_id', data)
```

3. **Execute the Flow**:
   Run the flow to perform the data ingestion.

```bash
python path/to/your_flow.py
```

## Examples

### Ingesting Data from Google Sheets

The repository includes examples demonstrating data ingestion from Google Sheets:

- **Direct Method**: Specify the sheet ID and source ID directly.
- **Dynamic Method**: Retrieve the sheet ID and source ID from a CSV file in a GitHub repository.

Refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/trufnetwork/adapters/tree/main/src/examples) for detailed implementations.
