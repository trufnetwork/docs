# Developer Bounties Overview

The [**truf.network Developer Bounties Marketplace**](https://github.com/orgs/trufnetwork/projects/2) is a platform where data consumers can request new data streams and developers can actively contribute to building the truf.network ecosystem.

## Key Objectives

- **For Data Consumers:** Submit data stream requests to shape the future of truf.network’s ecosystem.
- **For Developers:** Participate in fulfilling critical data needs by building data streams or adapters.

## How It Works

1. Data consumers submit their requests with specific requirements, sources, and offered compensation.
2. Developers can browse the bounty board, pick tasks, and start building.
3. Both parties collaborate through the truf.network’s GitHub and development tools.
